Example usecase -----

Checkstyle performance analysis:
At one point in time, Checkstyle mysteriously started taking longer. Why did this happen? When *exactly* did this happen?

Schema ----
Table 1 - Builds
    (Build scan list page)
    user
    project
    console log (lower priority)

Table 2 - Task Executions
    (Deep dive into a single build page)
    path
    taskId
    buildId (foreign key into builds table)
    startTime
    finishTime
    duration
    status (pass/fail)

Note ----
Large parallel build start/stop events for a given task may be interleaved, must keep track of task ID to correctly correlate
