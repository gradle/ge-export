Example usecase -----

Checkstyle performance analysis:
At one point in time, Checkstyle mysteriously started taking longer. Why did this happen? When *exactly* did this happen?

Schema ----
Table 1 - Builds
    (Build scan list page)
    user
    project
    tasksId (foreign key into tasks table)

Table 2 - Task Executions
    (Deep dive into a single build page)
    path
    id
    buildId (foreign key into builds table)
    startTime
    endTime
    duration
    log (working under assumption that any log messages between startevent and stopevent are from that task)
    status (pass/fail)

Note ----
Large parallel build start/stop events for a given task may be interleaved, must keep track of task ID to correctly correlate
